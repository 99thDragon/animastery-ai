Key characteristics:
- Hand-drawn frames
- Fluid, organic motion
- Expressive character designs
- Rich, detailed backgrounds
- Classic Disney style

## 2D Digital Animation
Modern 2D animation uses digital tools while maintaining the aesthetic of traditional animation. This style combines the classic look with modern efficiency.

Key characteristics:
- Digital drawing tools
- Vector-based graphics
- Clean, crisp lines
- Efficient production pipeline
- Examples: Steven Universe, Gravity Falls

## 3D Animation
3D animation creates characters and environments in a three-dimensional space, allowing for realistic movement and camera work.

Key characteristics:
- Three-dimensional models
- Rigging and skeletal animation
- Realistic physics simulation
- Dynamic camera movements
- Examples: Pixar films, DreamWorks animations

## Stop Motion
Stop motion animation creates movement by physically manipulating objects frame by frame.

Key characteristics:
- Physical models and sets
- Frame-by-frame photography
- Tactile, textured look
- Unique, handmade aesthetic
- Examples: Wallace & Gromit, Coraline

## Motion Graphics
Motion graphics focuses on animated graphic design elements, often used in title sequences and informational videos.

Key characteristics:
- Typography animation
- Geometric shapes
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Information visualization
- Examples: Title sequences, explainer videos

## Anime Style
Japanese animation has developed its own distinct style with specific conventions and techniques.

Key characteristics:
- Large, expressive eyes
- Stylized character designs
- Dramatic camera angles
- Limited animation techniques
- Examples: Studio Ghibli films, Attack on Titan

## Experimental Animation
Experimental animation pushes the boundaries of traditional animation techniques and storytelling.

Key characteristics:
- Unconventional techniques
- Abstract visuals
- Non-linear storytelling
- Mixed media approaches
- Examples: Abstract short films, art installations
